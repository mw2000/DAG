# Introdution
This project is a spin-off of a decentralized autonomous organization, called "Decentralized Autonomous Government" (DAG). Democracy was founded 'for the people, by the people, and of the people', but in today's scenario, representatives have more power than the people who vote for them. This introduces and inherent flaw in the system, which was supposed to represent the interests of the people.
To counter this we came up with the idea of DAG, a platform representing the ideas, opinions and decisions of the people. Here people can come up with key policy, have a vote, and based on the vote, it will be added to the system or not added to the system. Similarly, they can vote on resolutions, hire commitees to come up with laws which they can vote on, decide on government contracts, throw out (or more specifically **fire**) commitee members which they feel aren't doing work.
The DAG will replace the Legislative Wing of our current Government system and drastically reduce the power of the executive to a figurehead. The Judicial branch will however still be separate, so to avoid unlawful populist opinion be overturned.
In terms of the software, this repo will act as a webApp where the users can interact with the backend built in Solidity (Ethereum Blockchain).

## TODO
- Need to change the structure of the smart contracts.
- Need way to introduce promotion and demotion of members. (**PRIORITY**)

## HackDavis 2020
For HackDavis, we aim this to be a framework to be used for ASUCD, therefore we will make it more 'personalized' as an alternative to the ASUCD. We will be looking at the functions they perform, and making software to replace the same.

## Technologies to be used
